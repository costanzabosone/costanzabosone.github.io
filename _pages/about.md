I am a first-year Post-Doctoral Researcher jointly affiliated with the [Department of Statistical Sciences](https://stat.duke.edu/) at Duke University and the [Department of Economics and Management](https://economiaemanagement.dip.unipv.it/en) at the University of Pavia. I will be teaching [Introduction to Game Theory](https://focus.duke.edu/clusters-courses/modeling-economic-and-social-sciences) at Duke in the fall of 2025.

My research applies machine learning to economic modeling, focusing on enhancing the interpretability of the **Random Forests** algorithm. My current application is in the field of **international trade**.

I recently completed my PhD in Economic Statistics at the [University of Pavia](https://economiaemanagement.dip.unipv.it/en) and the [University School for Advanced Studies (IUSS)-Pavia](https://www.iusspavia.it/en), under the supervision of 
Prof. [Paolo Giudici](https://sites.google.com/a/unipv.it/giudici/paolo-giudici).  During my PhD, I was trainee at the **European Central Bank (ECB)** and research fellow at the **Bank of International Settlements (BIS)**.
